# Gameplay Guide

Welcome, hacker! This guide will walk you through the Cyberpunk Decryption experience and provide tips for solving the puzzles you'll encounter.

## Objective

Your mission is to navigate through different systems of a corporate mainframe, solve puzzles, and collect fragments of a hidden message. Once you've gathered all the fragments, you'll need to decrypt the full message.

## Gameplay Flow

1. **Start at the Digital Nexus (index.html)**
   - Read the mission briefing
   - Choose which system to access first

2. **Data Stream Puzzle (data-stream.html)**
   - Observe the flowing binary data
   - Find a hidden 4-digit code within the stream
   - Enter the code to reveal the first message fragment

3. **Neural Network Puzzle (neural-network.html)**
   - Interact with the neural network visualization
   - Activate the glowing nodes in the correct sequence
   - Check your activation to reveal the second message fragment

4. **Return to Digital Nexus**
   - Once you've collected all fragments, return to the main page
   - Use the collected fragments to decrypt the final message

## Puzzle-Solving Tips

### Data Stream Puzzle
- The hidden code will be a sequence of four digits (0-9) amidst the binary data
- The code's position changes with each new data stream, so keep watching closely
- You can pause the stream by hovering your mouse over it (desktop only)

### Neural Network Puzzle
- Pay attention to nodes that glow differently from the others
- The order of activation matters - try to find a pattern in the node layout
- You can deactivate a node by clicking it again if you make a mistake

## Hints and Help

If you're stuck on a puzzle:
- Take a break and come back with fresh eyes
- Try to approach the puzzle from a different angle
- Look for subtle clues in the visuals or audio of each page

Remember, the thrill is in the challenge! But if you need additional help, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
